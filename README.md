Hello!

This is a REALLY simple and BASIC Linux Distro Chooser, if your confused on what distribution to download this is the place!

It ranges from Gaming all the way to Servers!

Please contribute to this little application. I am not and never will make money from this.

This is just a heads up so check out the installation.md!
